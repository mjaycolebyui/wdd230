            <p>
                The target audience of this site will mostly be people who are visiting nearby temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
                However, one does not need to be a member of that church to stay at the hotels.

                Kimberly
            </h3>
            <p>
                Kimberly is a member of the church, and wants to visit the various temple locations.
                Because her primary objective of her trip is to visit the local temple, she wants to book a hotel that is nearby that
                has easy access services to the temple.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Tom
            </h3>
            <p>
                Tom is not a member of the church. However, he wants to visit a museum near the local temple,
                so be books the hotel that best accomodates that location. He also has heard of the integrity of 
                church members, so he feels he can trust a hotel that specifically caters to that demographic.
