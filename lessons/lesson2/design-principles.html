                            Shopper Approved does an excellent job of utilizing white space to make their site look clean and concise.
                            They simplify their site down to the main content, and they draw the eye to the bright "Get Started" button.
                            As a result, the user has no questions about how to navigate the site. They know the menu is clearly on the top-right, as there is plenty of white space around the menu icon, and the chat box for help is clear on the bottom-right for the same reasons.

                            Amazon has appropriate proximity placing of the elements on its site.
                            For instance, the header is the most important part of their site - it allows the user to search for a product, and also provides the navigation bar for almost anything the user would need.
                            Then, it goes through its hierarchy of importance - the ads based on the most recent searches, then ads similar to previously purchased items. 
                            The proximity also shows what Amazon is clearly trying to advertize - the smart thermostat.

                            Hick's Law is all about user choice. If you give a user too many choices, it will take them longer to make a decision.
                            To alleviate that issue, the website should have clear, simple choices for a user to make - and not too many at that!
                            Etsy starts off right - broad categories that narrow down what the user would be searching for before launching into a catelogue of all the potential options.
